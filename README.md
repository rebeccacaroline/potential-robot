This awesome app will tell you what to wear depending on the local weather!

Users can log in with their zip code and personal style, and they will get personalized style advice based on their settings. Users can change their location at any time.

If someone does not want an account, that person can still get basic advice about what to wear by inputting the local zip code.

Technologies used in this project are Sinatra, Ruby, JavaScript, AJAX, HTML5, CSS, and Skeleton.
